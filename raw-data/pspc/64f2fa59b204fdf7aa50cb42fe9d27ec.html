      <td>Fraser Port of Entry Redevelopment. The scope of work is a multi phase process-as identified with the Call-Up Planning document-the original scope or work involved a preliminary investigation to identify the scope or work, and until the result of the investigation is assessed and decisions made, were we able to define the next step of the service which would be for design and services during construction. The value of the initial investigation is always much smaller than the overall scope of work, and the subsequent increase in fees would appear large as a percentage of original. This contract is a multi-year contract</td>

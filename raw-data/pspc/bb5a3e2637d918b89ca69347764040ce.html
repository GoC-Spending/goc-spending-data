      <td>CBSA Stewart- Port Redevelopment .The scope of the work is a multi  phase process-as identified with the Call-Up Planning document- The original scope of work involved a preliminiary investigation to identify the scope or work, and until the result of the investigation is assessed and decision made, were we able to define the next step of the service which would be for design and sevices during  construction. The value of the initial investigation is always much smaller than the overall scope of work, and the subsequent increas in fees would appear large as a percentage of original. This contract is a multi-year contract</td>

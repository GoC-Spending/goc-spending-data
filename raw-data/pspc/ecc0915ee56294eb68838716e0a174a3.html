      <td>Pleasant Camp/Fraser Redevelopment. The scope of the work is a multi phase process-as identified with the Call-Up Planning document-the original scope of work involved a preliminary investigation to identified the scope of work, and until the result of the investigation is assessed and decisions made, were we able to define the next step of the service which would be for design and sevices during construction. The value of the initial investigation is always much smaller than the overall scope of work, and the subsequent increase in fees would appear large as a percentage of orginal. This contract is a multi-year contract</td>

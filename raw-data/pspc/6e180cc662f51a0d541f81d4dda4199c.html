      <td>The objective is to acquire contractors to support PWGSC-Learning during its first year of operation. The contractor will be required to work within the LCMR to plan, develop and test new learning products, and to align processes and functionality to ensure effective and efficient operation of PWGSC-Learning.     For a contract with task authorizations, the realized amount of the contract is contingent on the number of task authorizations issued and may be less than the amount proactively disclosed, dependent on the operational requirements of the department.

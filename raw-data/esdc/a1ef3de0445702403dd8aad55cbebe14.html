      This is a notice of the restatement of Contract 100003685 dated February 13, 2015. The contract was not captured by our financial system and the issue has been corrected since then.
For a contract with task authorizations, the realized amount of the contract is contingent on the number of task authorizations issued and may be less than the amount proactively disclosed, dependent on the operational requirements of the department.

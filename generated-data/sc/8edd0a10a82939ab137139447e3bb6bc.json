The feasibility study will establish a baseline for current processes, effort and cost to administer existing ROE services, identify the estimated costs and benefits associated with the transition to mandatory eROE, and will include potential savings available to the employer community. The analysis will be general in nature (i.e. within an order of magnitude) and used to support the Department's evaluation of the benefits and costs to this proposal.",

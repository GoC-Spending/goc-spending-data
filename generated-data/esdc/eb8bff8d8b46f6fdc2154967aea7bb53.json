The objective of this project is to provide ESDC with a written narrative with supporting documents for the preparation of federal affidavits for an upcoming court case regarding the delivery of employment services in BC in both Official Languages. The consultant is based out of BC and this project involves several hundred hours of research, writing and interviews, mainly within the BC region.

    "comments": "At the request of TBS, both the Fall 2014 and recent TFWP TB Submissions committed ESDC to developing and finalizing a Performance Measurement (PM) Strategy for the Program in light of the reforms implemented in June 2014. Given that we are already one year out from the reforms, TBS has further indicated to TFWP officials that the new PM Strategy should be completed as soon as possible to be consistent with the TBS Policy on Evaluation as it pertains to performance measurement. In light of this urgency, TFWP officials reached out informally to partners within the department to identify possible contractors that could conduct this work. This request yielded only one suggested contractor who had the right mix of experience in the development of PM strategies and familiarity with both the department's mandate as well as the objectives of the Program.",
